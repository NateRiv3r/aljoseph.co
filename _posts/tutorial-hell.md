Learning new technologies is hard, which is why tutorials are helpful to ease the learning process. However, over-dependence on them can slow your development growth.

Just think of this, you are sitting in front of your computer and ready to learn a new programming language. You start finding tutorials or courses on the internet to have an idea on how to get started. You followed your instructor step by step. But as you continue watching halfway, you just felt your mind is going blank. You were overwhelmed by the information you gained and have not a clear idea when you start reading your code. All that is left is the feeling of uncertainty that you cannot scale your project.

It is a common situation where beginners fell in. I knew learning to code on your own is difficult, and I wanted to share my experience on how I got out of tutorial hell.
